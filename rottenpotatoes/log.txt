Feature: search for movies by director
  As a movie buff
  So that I can find movies with my favorite director
  I want to include and serach on director information in movies I enter

  Background: movies in database      # features/director_search.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist: # features/step_definitions/movies_steps.rb:1
      | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
      | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas | 1977-05-25   |
      | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott | 1982-06-25   |
      | Alien        | R      |              | 1979-05-25   |
      | THX-1138     | R      | George Lucas | 1971-03-11   |
